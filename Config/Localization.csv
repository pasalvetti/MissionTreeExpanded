Missions/Primary/PM04/Description,Text,,"We are going all in! A proper Munar orbit!"
Missions/Primary/PM04/Brief02,Text,,"Yesterday I slept for the first time in a few days. Who knew a caffeine crash could provide such restful sleep?  
Anyway, I brewed some fresh pots for everyone in <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style> so we can cut down on all that unnecessary blinking! With your help, we’re going to pull off our first Mun orbit!"



Missions/Primary/MTE01/Name,Text,,"Fly by the Mun"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Description,Text,,"Time to visit our nearest neighbor, the Mun!"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Objective,Text,,"Enter the Mun's SOI."

Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief01,Text,,"Ah, Director!
You wouldn't believe the chaos. Absolute, utter chaos. You see, I may have… overindulged in the Macchiato Mk1. It's… invigorating. To say the least. I haven't slept in days! I've been bouncing off the walls, reorganizing the entire <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style> filing system by color. It's… a masterpiece."
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief02,Text,,"Anyway, the point is, I need to slow down. Cut back. Maybe try a… decaf? The thought horrifies me, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
And speaking of desperate measures, it's time for a new challenge!"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief03,Text,,"You've conquered orbit. Now, it's time to <i>brush shoulders</i> with the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>! Well, not literally. That would be messy.
<style=""TXT-Objective"">Enter the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>’s SOI (Sphere Of Influence).</style>"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief04,Text,,"I know, I know. ‘But Dr. Kerman,' you're probably thinking, ‘aiming for an object so high in the sky sounds… difficult.' And you'd be absolutely right. It's going to require precision, patience, and possibly a few more cups of… <i>decaf</i>."
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief05,Text,,"I'll let you in on a little secret. The trick to succeeding in this mission is to wait until you see the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style> rise on the horizon, and burn prograde. That way you can't miss it! Be careful not to crash into it, though.
You can thanks the engineers at <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style>, I would never have found this on my own…"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief06,Text,,"Good luck, Director! And try not to get too distracted by the munar landscape. It's… quite mesmerizing."

Missions/Primary/MTE01/Debrief01,Text,,"Greetings, Director! Welcome back!"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Debrief02,Text,,"What a view! I practically camped out in the observation deck for your munar flyby. That shimmering rock… it's absolutely breathtaking! You know, seeing the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style> so close… it really makes you realize how vast and incredible space truly is."
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Debrief03,Text,,"Now, it's time to take the next logical step. But for now you can enjoy a well-deserved rest. Why not pay a visit to <style=""KSC-RD-Center"">the R&D Center</style> to discover what new technologies they have come up with? It will give me time to prepare the next brief!"




Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Name,Text,,"The Ice Spy"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Description,Text,,"What does the North Pole look like exactly? Time to find out!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Objective,Text,,"Achieve an orbit around Kerbin with a 90 degree inclinaison."

Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief01,Text,,"Director, I've been doing some… <i>very</i> important research here at <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style>. Specifically, I've been staring at maps of <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>. And I've noticed something… peculiar."
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief02,Text,,"The North Pole."
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief03,Text,,"It's just… there. All snowy and… whity. We know very little about its composition. How big is it? What is it temperature? Is it made of sugar?"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief04,Text,,"So, I’ve devised a new mission, one that will strengthen our scientific knowledge. You need to fly over the North Pole so that we can have a look at the situation. A <i>polar</i> orbit, you ask? Yes!
<style="TXT-Objective">Achieve an orbit around <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style> with a 90 degree inclinaison.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief05,Text,,"Good luck, and don’t do anything… <i>polarizing</i>!"

Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief01,Text,,"By my stars, the pictures you sent us confirmed what I suspected all along! The North Pole is a vast expanse of frozen water! Not sugar, as some… <i>less informed</i> individuals might have speculated. Which is fine, I never put sugar in my coffee. It’s a great day for accurate cartography!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief02,Text,,"You’ve proven that you can handle even the most demanding orbital maneuvers, Director. A polar orbit is no small feat!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief03,Text,,"Now, this has given me an idea. These images are just a starting point. We’ve only scratched the surface, so to speak. There’s so much more to learn about the polar regions. The ice thickness, the underlying geology, the atmospheric conditions… it’s a treasure trove of scientific data waiting to be uncovered."
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief04,Text,,"Come back in a few while I set up a new mission!"





Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Name,Text,,"Polar Reconnaissance"
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Description,Text,,"We need to take a closer look at this icy North Pole."
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Objective,Text,,"Land an unmanned probe on Kerbin’s North Pole."

Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Brief01,Text,,"Good, you’re here. Excellent work on the polar orbit! However, merely <i>seeing</i> the ice is not enough. We need to know more. Is it stable? Is it safe? Is it… <i>solid</i> enough for Kerbal boots?"
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Brief02,Text,,"That's why I've devised our next mission: a polar landing! But not with Kerbals just yet. We're sending a probe first. We need to be absolutely certain it's safe before we risk any of our brave explorers."
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Brief03,Text,,"And I have to give credit where credit is due. We wouldn't even <i>be</i> considering a polar landing if it wasn't for Dunmar Kerman. You know Dunmar, our resident glaciologist? He’s been absolutely relentless! He’s been practically living in the management offices, armed with charts, graphs, and… well, let's just say he’s very persuasive. He finally convinced them to… <i>unfreeze</i> some funds for further polar research.

<style="TXT-Objective">Land an unmanned probe on <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>’s North Pole.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Brief04,Text,,"We need to understand the composition, the density, the… <i>Kerbal-foot-friendliness</i> of this icy terrain, Director. We need to know if the ice can support the weight of a lander, or even a Kerbal on foot. We need to know if there are any hidden dangers lurking beneath the surface. We can’t have any unexpected… <i>ice-idents</i>. He he.

Good luck, as always!"

Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Debrief01,Text,,"Director! Fantastic work! The probe has landed safely at the North Pole and the data is pouring in! It looks like Dunmar Kerman's insistence was spot on – this ice is packed tight!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Debrief02,Text,,"Thanks to your precise landing and the probe's reliable instruments, we now have the data we need to confidently plan our next phase of polar exploration."
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Debrief03,Text,,"I'm pleased to announce that Dunmar's next proposal has been greenlit! He's somehow managed to convince management that we need a to send an expedition crew at the North Pole! I’m not entirely sure how he did it – I suspect some form of advanced glaciological hypnosis was involved – but the paperwork is signed, the funds are allocated."
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Debrief04,Text,,"Well done! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go find Dunmar before he starts building ice sculptures of himself."





Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Name,Text,,"Operation Cold Feet"
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Description,Text,,"The icy steppes of the North Pole have never seen a Kerbal. It’s time to fix this."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Objective,Text,,"Plant a flag at the geographical North Pole of Kerbin."

Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief01,Text,,"Director, I’m worrying about Dunmar. He hasn't stopped talking about polar exploration since we send that probe. I think he’s even started referring to himself as 'Lord of the Ice.' We might need to have a word with him about that."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief02,Text,,"Anyway, on to the next big step: a Kerbal presence at the North Pole! And Dunmar, ever the visionary, has a grand idea. He believes that planting a flag at the precise geographical North Pole would be a powerful symbol of our agency's achievements. He says it would inspire the Kerbal public, boost our visibility, and, most importantly, make it much easier to secure funding for future projects.

<style="TXT-Objective">Your mission is to plant a flag at the precise geographical North Pole of <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief03,Text,,"We have to be precise in our flag-planting business, as Dunmar has already planned a live broadcast of the event, and he insists on having it shown on every screen on <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>. No pressure! In order to help you, a marker will appear on the map showing you the coordinates."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief04,Text,,"This mission is about more than just science, Director. It’s about showing the world what we’re capable of. And it’s about making sure Dunmar doesn’t have to resort to… <i>other</i> methods of securing funding. I shudder to think what those might be."
Missions/Primary/MTES03/Brief05,Text,,"Good luck, Director! And may your aim be true!"

Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Debrief01,Text,,"Well done, Director, the flag is planted! Right at the precise geographical North Pole! The broadcast was a smashing success! I haven’t seen this many Kerbals glued to their screens since… well, since the last time we launched a rocket, but this was different!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Debrief02,Text,,"The images of the flag snapping in the polar wind are already iconic. Dunmar is ecstatic. He’s been giving interviews to every news outlet on <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>, talking about “the dawn of a new era of polar exploration” and “the symbolic union of Kerbalkind with the icy north.” He even tried to convince them to rename the North Pole “Dunmar’s Peak,” but thankfully, that didn’t stick."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Debrief03,Text,,"But the best news? The success of this mission has sparked serious discussions about establishing a permanent research presence at the North Pole! The higher-ups are finally seeing the value of long-term polar research. They’re talking about building a research outpost, a scientific hub at the top of the world! And it’s all thanks to you."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Debrief04,Text,,"You’ve not only planted a flag, Director, you’ve planted the seed for a whole new chapter in Kerbal history. You’ve shown the world that we can achieve anything we set our minds to, even when it involves navigating to a tiny point on a giant sphere. You should be proud!"
