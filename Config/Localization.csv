Missions/Primary/PM04/Description,Text,,"We are going all in! A proper Munar orbit!"
Missions/Primary/PM04/Brief02,Text,,"Yesterday I slept for the first time in a few days. Who knew a caffeine crash could provide such restful sleep?  
Anyway, I brewed some fresh pots for everyone in <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style> so we can cut down on all that unnecessary blinking! With your help, we’re going to pull off our first Mun orbit!"



Missions/Primary/MTE01/Name,Text,,"Fly by the Mun"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Description,Text,,"Time to visit our nearest neighbor, the Mun!"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Objective,Text,,"Enter the Mun's SOI."

Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief01,Text,,"Ah, Director!
You wouldn't believe the chaos. Absolute, utter chaos. You see, I may have… overindulged in the Macchiato Mk1. It's… invigorating. To say the least. I haven't slept in days! I've been bouncing off the walls, reorganizing the entire <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style> filing system by color. It's… a masterpiece."
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief02,Text,,"Anyway, the point is, I need to slow down. Cut back. Maybe try a… decaf? The thought horrifies me, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
And speaking of desperate measures, it's time for a new challenge!"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief03,Text,,"You've conquered orbit. Now, it's time to <i>brush shoulders</i> with the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>! Well, not literally. That would be messy.
<style=""TXT-Objective"">Enter the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>’s SOI (Sphere Of Influence).</style>"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief04,Text,,"I know, I know. ‘But Dr. Kerman,' you're probably thinking, ‘aiming for an object so high in the sky sounds… difficult.' And you'd be absolutely right. It's going to require precision, patience, and possibly a few more cups of… <i>decaf</i>."
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief05,Text,,"I'll let you in on a little secret. The trick to succeeding in this mission is to wait until you see the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style> rise on the horizon, and burn prograde. That way you can't miss it! Be careful not to crash into it, though.
You can thanks the engineers at <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style>, I would never have found this on my own…"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Brief06,Text,,"Good luck, Director! And try not to get too distracted by the munar landscape. It's… quite mesmerizing."

Missions/Primary/MTE01/Debrief01,Text,,"Greetings, Director! Welcome back!"
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Debrief02,Text,,"What a view! I practically camped out in the observation deck for your munar flyby. That shimmering rock… it's absolutely breathtaking! You know, seeing the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style> so close… it really makes you realize how vast and incredible space truly is."
Missions/Primary/MTE01/Debrief03,Text,,"Now, it's time to take the next logical step. But for now you can enjoy a well-deserved rest. Why not pay a visit to <style=""KSC-RD-Center"">the R&D Center</style> to discover what new technologies they have come up with? It will give me time to prepare the next brief!"





Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Name,Text,,"The Ice Spy"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Description,Text,,"What does the North Pole look like exactly? Time to find out!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Objective,Text,,"Achieve an orbit around Kerbin with a 90 degree inclinaison."

Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief01,Text,,"Director, I've been doing some… <i>very</i> important research here at <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style>. Specifically, I've been staring at maps of <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>. And I've noticed something… peculiar."
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief02,Text,,"The North Pole."
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief03,Text,,"It's just… there. All snowy and… whity. We know very little about its composition. How big is it? What is it temperature? Is it made of sugar?"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief04,Text,,"So, I’ve devised a new mission, one that will strengthen our scientific knowledge. You need to fly over the North Pole so that we can have a look at the situation. A <i>polar</i> orbit, you ask? Yes!
<style="TXT-Objective">Achieve an orbit around <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style> with a 90 degree inclinaison.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief05,Text,,"Good luck, and don’t do anything… <i>polarizing</i>!"

Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief01,Text,,"By my stars, the pictures you sent us confirmed what I suspected all along! The North Pole is a vast expanse of frozen water! Not sugar, as some… <i>less informed</i> individuals might have speculated. Which is fine, I never put sugar in my coffee. It’s a great day for accurate cartography!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief02,Text,,"You’ve proven that you can handle even the most demanding orbital maneuvers, Director. A polar orbit is no small feat!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief03,Text,,"Now, this has given me an idea. These images are just a starting point. We’ve only scratched the surface, so to speak. There’s so much more to learn about the polar regions. The ice thickness, the underlying geology, the atmospheric conditions… it’s a treasure trove of scientific data waiting to be uncovered."
Missions/Secondary/MTES01/Brief04,Text,,"Come back in a few while I set up a new mission!"





Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Name,Text,,"Polar Reconnaissance"
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Description,Text,,"We need to take a closer look at this icy North Pole."
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Objective,Text,,"Land an unmanned probe on Kerbin’s North Pole."

Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Brief01,Text,,"Good, you’re here. Excellent work on the polar orbit! However, merely <i>seeing</i> the ice is not enough. We need to know more. Is it stable? Is it safe? Is it… <i>solid</i> enough for Kerbal boots?"
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Brief02,Text,,"That's why I've devised our next mission: a polar landing! But not with Kerbals just yet. We're sending a probe first. We need to be absolutely certain it's safe before we risk any of our brave explorers."
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Brief03,Text,,"And I have to give credit where credit is due. We wouldn't even <i>be</i> considering a polar landing if it wasn't for Dunmar Kerman. You know Dunmar, our resident glaciologist? He’s been absolutely relentless! He’s been practically living in the management offices, armed with charts, graphs, and… well, let's just say he’s very persuasive. He finally convinced them to… <i>unfreeze</i> some funds for further polar research.

<style="TXT-Objective">Land an unmanned probe on <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>’s North Pole.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Brief04,Text,,"We need to understand the composition, the density, the… <i>Kerbal-foot-friendliness</i> of this icy terrain, Director. We need to know if the ice can support the weight of a lander, or even a Kerbal on foot. We need to know if there are any hidden dangers lurking beneath the surface. We can’t have any unexpected… <i>ice-idents</i>. He he.

Good luck, as always!"

Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Debrief01,Text,,"Director! Fantastic work! The probe has landed safely at the North Pole and the data is pouring in! It looks like Dunmar Kerman's insistence was spot on – this ice is packed tight!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Debrief02,Text,,"Thanks to your precise landing and the probe's reliable instruments, we now have the data we need to confidently plan our next phase of polar exploration."
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Debrief03,Text,,"I'm pleased to announce that Dunmar's next proposal has been greenlit! He's somehow managed to convince management that we need a to send an expedition crew at the North Pole! I’m not entirely sure how he did it – I suspect some form of advanced glaciological hypnosis was involved – but the paperwork is signed, the funds are allocated."
Missions/Secondary/MTES02/Debrief04,Text,,"Well done! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go find Dunmar before he starts building ice sculptures of himself."





Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Name,Text,,"Operation Cold Feet"
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Description,Text,,"The icy steppes of the North Pole have never seen a Kerbal. It’s time to fix this."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Objective,Text,,"Plant a flag at the geographical North Pole of Kerbin."

Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief01,Text,,"Director, I’m worrying about Dunmar. He hasn't stopped talking about polar exploration since we send that probe. I think he’s even started referring to himself as 'Lord of the Ice.' We might need to have a word with him about that."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief02,Text,,"Anyway, on to the next big step: a Kerbal presence at the North Pole! And Dunmar, ever the visionary, has a grand idea. He believes that planting a flag at the precise geographical North Pole would be a powerful symbol of our agency's achievements. He says it would inspire the Kerbal public, boost our visibility, and, most importantly, make it much easier to secure funding for future projects.

<style="TXT-Objective">Your mission is to plant a flag at the precise geographical North Pole of <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief03,Text,,"We have to be precise in our flag-planting business, as Dunmar has already planned a live broadcast of the event, and he insists on having it shown on every screen on <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>. No pressure! In order to help you, a marker will appear on the map showing you the coordinates."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief04,Text,,"This mission is about more than just science, Director. It’s about showing the world what we’re capable of. And it’s about making sure Dunmar doesn’t have to resort to… <i>other</i> methods of securing funding. I shudder to think what those might be."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Brief05,Text,,"Good luck, Director! And may your aim be true!"

Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Debrief01,Text,,"Well done, Director, the flag is planted! Right at the precise geographical North Pole! The broadcast was a smashing success! I haven’t seen this many Kerbals glued to their screens since… well, since the last time we launched a rocket, but this was different!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Debrief02,Text,,"The images of the flag snapping in the polar wind are already iconic. Dunmar is ecstatic. He’s been giving interviews to every news outlet on <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>, talking about “the dawn of a new era of polar exploration” and “the symbolic union of Kerbalkind with the icy north.” He even tried to convince them to rename the North Pole “Dunmar’s Peak” but, thankfully, that didn’t stick."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Debrief03,Text,,"But the best news? The success of this mission has sparked serious discussions about establishing a permanent research presence at the North Pole! The higher-ups are finally seeing the value of long-term polar research. They’re talking about building a research outpost, a scientific hub at the top of the world! And it’s all thanks to you."
Missions/Secondary/MTES03/Debrief04,Text,,"You’ve not only planted a flag, Director, you’ve planted the seed for a whole new chapter in Kerbal history. You’ve shown the world that we can achieve anything we set our minds to, even when it involves navigating to a tiny point on a giant sphere. You should be proud!"




Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Name,Text,,"The Frozen Frontier"
Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Description,Text,,"We have a go to establish the first research station at the North Pole."
Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Objective,Text,,"Land a base station at the North Pole with a RGSCM-01 science experiment and three Kerbals."

Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Brief01,Text,,"Public support is at an all-time high, and Dunmar… well, he’s finally calmed down a bit. He’s stopped wearing that makeshift ice crown, at least. But he’s already moved on to his next grand scheme: a permanent research station at the North Pole!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Brief02,Text,,"And you know what? Management actually agreed! They were so impressed with the positive feedback from the flag mission that they’ve given us the go-ahead to establish a polar outpost. This will be a state-of-the-art facility, equipped with everything our scientists need to study the polar environment. And, perhaps more importantly, it will serve as Dunmar’s… <i>summer retreat</i>. He’s already packing his thermal underwear and a lifetime supply of hot cocoa."
Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Brief03,Text,,"Now, we’re not aiming for the <i>exact</i> geographical North Pole this time. Anywhere above the 80th parallel will do. We want a location that’s relatively flat, stable, and preferably not too close to any active glaciers. We don’t want Dunmar’s retreat to become an impromptu ice floe.

<style="TXT-Objective">Establish a permanent research station at the North Pole, above the 80th parallel. The station must be equipped with a RGSCM-01 “Science Jr. Jr.” and crewed by three Kerbals.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Brief04,Text,,"Good luck, Director. This is a big undertaking, but I know you’re up to the challenge."

Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Debrief01,Text,,"It’s a magnificent sight over there at the North Pole Research Station – a beacon of science amidst the icy wilderness! We now have a fully functional research outpost at the top of <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Debrief02,Text,,"Dunmar wants to move in. He has started issuing decrees about proper igloo etiquette. We’re working on getting him to tone it down a bit."
Missions/Secondary/MTES04/Debrief03,Text,,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go mediate a dispute between Dunmar and the station’s botanist about the optimal temperature for growing ice lettuce."






Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Name,Text,,"Phone Home"
Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Description,Text,,"We need to monitor that mysterious signal closely. Unfortunately, the Mun is not yet connected to the Internet. No matter! Let’s deploy its first telecommunication satellite."
Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Objective,Text,,"Orbit the Mun with a periapsis of at least 1900km, a RA-2 antenna dish and no crew."

Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Brief01,Text,,"Director! I’m still shaken up by the discovery of that monument on the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>… it’s unlike anything we’ve ever encountered!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Brief02,Text,,"We’ve analyzed the signal as best we can, but it’s weak and intermittent. We need a more consistent way to monitor it, to try and decipher its meaning. That’s why we’re launching a communication satellite."
Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Brief03,Text,,"We need to maintain a constant datafeed with <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style> to capture every blip of that signal. That means minimizing signal occlusion by the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style> itself. A periapsis of 1  900 kilometers will ensure that the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style> doesn’t block the satellite’s line of sight to <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style> for extended periods. Also, we are going to need a powerful relay antenna. Be sure to check with R&D that they have what we need. I know they were working on developing an antenna that can cover the entire <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style> system.

<style="TXT-Objective">Establish a stable orbit around the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style> with a periapsis of at least 1900km with an unmanned craft carrying a RA-2 antenna dish.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Brief04,Text,,"This mission could be the key to unlocking a wealth of knowledge about the universe. This isn’t just about science anymore; this is about understanding our place in the cosmos."

Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Debrief01,Text,,"I’m happy to report that communications with our new satellite are crystal clear! The high periapsis is doing exactly what we hoped – minimal occlusion."
Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Debrief02,Text,,"We’re receiving a steady stream of data now. Our analysts are already pouring over it, trying to decipher the patterns, the meaning behind the signal. It’s still a mystery, but with this continuous feed, I’m sure we’ll be making progress."
Missions/Secondary/MTES05/Debrief03,Text,,"Oh- if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to the analysis room. We’re picking up some interesting fluctuations in the signal, and I don’t want to miss a thing."





Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Name,Text,,"Dunmar's Joyride"
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Description,Text,,"The team at the North Pole Research Station lack comfort and mobility to performe their experiment. They need more wheels."
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Objective,Text,,"Send a rover to the North Pole with four wheels, an antenna, a solar panel and the Mk2 copckit."

Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Brief01,Text,,"Director, we’ve received a <i>chilly</i> message from the team at the North Pole Research Station. Apparently, exploring the vast icy steppes of <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style>’s arctic by foot is proving a challenge."
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Brief02,Text,,"Dunmar reports that small stones keep getting into his thermal boots, and that his toes are starting to resemble… well, let’s just say he also mentioned something about a pedicure being required upon his return."
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Brief03,Text,,"Clearly, this situation calls for a solution. And that solution, Director, is wheels! We need to deliver a rover to the North Pole Research Station. It needs to have an antenna to stay in contact with the Station and solar panels to produce the necessary power to heat the cabin. We wouldn’t want Dunmar to catch a cold. Or, you know, become any colder than he already is."
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Brief04,Text,,"And while we’re at it, why don’t we design it with style and use the Mk2 cockpit? Some folks at Construction & Assembly needs to log a few more flight hours, that would be an excellent opportunity!

<style="TXT-Objective">Your objective is to deliver a four-wheel rover to the North Pole. It must have an antenna, a solar panel and the mk2 “Phoenix“ cockpit.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Brief05,Text,,"This rover will greatly expand the team’s operational area, allowing them to traverse the icy plains with greater ease and comfort. So, get that rover ready, Director! And maybe include a few pairs of extra-thick socks. Just in case.

Good luck, and may your journey be… <i>ice</i> and easy!"

Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Debrief01,Text,,"Good job, Director! I just received a transmission from Dunmar. He’s been taking the rover for test drives around the station and doing donuts in the snow. He even sent a photo of himself wearing a pair of oversized earmuffs while driving. It's… quite a sight."
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Debrief02,Text,,"He says his toes haven’t felt this warm since… well, since he left the Kerbal Space Center."
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Debrief03,Text,,"The team is already planning expeditions to explore the surrounding area to gather more data. I imagine they’ll also use it to get to the mess hall faster. I heard the hot cocoa there is top-notch."
Missions/Secondary/MTES06/Debrief04,Text,,"I need to go check on the supply manifest. I have a feeling we’re going to need to send up a lot more fuel for that rover. Dunmar seems to have developed a fondness for driving in circles. It’s for important scientific research, of course."






Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Name,Text,,"Whispers from the Mun"
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Description,Text,,"We’ve discovered what could be a new Mun signal. We need to go there and investigate."
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Objective,Text,,"Land on the Mun near the new location with three Kerbals."

Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Brief01,Text,,"Director… <i>[Dr. Kerman takes a deep breath and sighs]</i> Oh boy. I’ve done it again. All that excitement about the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>ar monument… I went a little overboard with the caffeine. I was up all night analyzing data, drawing diagrams on the whiteboard, and… well, let’s just say things got a little… <i>energetic</i>."
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Brief02,Text,,"So, I’ve decided to try something new. <i>[Dr. Kerman picks up a trombone and gives a short, slightly wobbly toot]</i> The trombone. Apparently, it’s supposed to be very calming. It’s… working, I think. Much better than bouncing off the walls."
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Brief03,Text,,"Anyway… <i>[She sets the trombone down carefully]</i> The comms satellite you deployed is doing a fantastic job. And… we’ve picked up something new. A very faint signal. It's so weak, it could be an echo of the original transmission. Or maybe someone from the previous crew forgot its phone there. You know how it is."
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Brief04,Text,,"Whatever it is, we need to investigate. We can't rely on the satellite alone. We need Kerbals on the ground to get a closer look.

<style="TXT-Objective">Your objective is to land a crew of three at the new signal location.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Brief05,Text,,"So, assemble a capable crew, equip them with the necessary scientific instruments, and prepare for a journey to the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>. As for me, this time, I’ll stick to the trombone."

Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Debrief01,Text,,"You’re back. Well… that’s that, then."
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Debrief02,Text,,"At least the mission was conclusive. The new signal… was just an echo. A simple reverberation bouncing off a pile of rocks. Nothing more. I was… hoping for something more. Something… <i>meaningful</i>."
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Debrief03,Text,,"It seems we got a little carried away. This is a reminder, I suppose, that science is a process of trial and error. Sometimes, you follow a lead that turns out to be a dead end. It’s frustrating, but it’s part of the job."
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Debrief04,Text,,"It seems we got a little carried away. This is a reminder, I suppose, that science is a process of trial and error. Sometimes, you follow a lead that turns out to be a dead end. It’s frustrating, but it’s part of the job.

You executed the mission flawlessly, of course. You followed up on every lead, no matter how faint. And for that, I thank you."
Missions/Secondary/MTES07/Debrief05,Text,,"Even though this particular investigation didn’t yield the results we were hoping for, it doesn’t diminish the importance of the initial discovery. The monument is still there. We may not understand it yet, but we will continue to study it. We will continue to search for answers.

And who knows? Maybe, one day, we’ll find what we’re looking for. But for now we’ll just have to keep listening."






Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Name,Text,,"Celestial Dialogue"
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Description,Text,,"Having a satellite orbiting the Mune is nice, but it doesn’t quite nail it yet! We need to establish a permanent Munar orbital station to learn more about the mysterious signal."
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Objective,Text,,"Establish a permanent orbital station around the Mun with at least five Kerbals and a minimum mass of 10 tons."

Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Brief01,Text,,"Oh hi, Director! I was about to call you. The data we’re receiving from the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>ar monument is fascinating, but it’s not enough. There’s still a lot we don’t know, and we need more than just satellite data. We need Kerbals in orbit around the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>, constantly monitoring the monument, analyzing the signal in real-time."
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Brief02,Text,,"That’s why we’re launching a new initiative: a permanent <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>ar orbital station! This will be a dedicated research facility, a home away from home for our brave Kerbalnauts as they unlock the secrets of this mysterious artifact."
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Brief03,Text,,"This isn’t just a quick flyby, Director. We’re talking about a long-term presence. This station needs to be spacious enough to accommodate a full crew of five scientists. I won’t be satisfied with anything less than a 10 ton station.

<style="TXT-Objective">Establish a permanent orbital station around the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style> with at least five Kerbals and a minimum mass of 10 tons.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Brief04,Text,,"I promise if you manage to pull this off I’ll learn trumpet in addition to the trombone!"

Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Debrief01,Text,,"Well done! About that… <i>trumpet</i> thing I mentioned earlier… let’s just… forget about that. I was clearly lacking caffeine. The trombone is enough, I think you’ll agree."
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Debrief02,Text,,"Anyway, have you heard the news, Director? The team at the station made a significant discovery. The signal strength from the <style=""OBJ-Mun"">Mun</style>ar monument… it’s not uniform. It is strongest towards… <style=""OBJ-Minmus"">Minmus</style>."
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Debrief03,Text,,"It’s as if the signal isn’t directed at <style=""OBJ-Kerbin"">Kerbin</style> at all, but at <style=""OBJ-Minmus"">Minmus</style>. As if the two moons are somehow… connected. This adds a whole new layer to the mystery. Why would this monument be transmitting a signal towards our smaller moon?"
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Debrief04,Text,,"I don’t know about you, but I’ve never eavesdrop on a conversation between two celestial bodies before!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES08/Debrief05,Text,,"This is a new direction for our research, and I have a feeling… this is just the beginning."







Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Name,Text,,"Picnic At Teetering Rock"
Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Description,Text,,"Satellite imagery has revealed an unusual rock formation on Minmus. Curiosity is strong among Kerbals, let’s not miss this opportunity to go out into the field!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Objective,Text,,"Land near the rock formation on Minmus."

Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Brief01,Text,,"Director! We’ve been reviewing some recent satellite imagery of <style=""OBJ-Minmus"">Minmus</style>, and we’ve spotted something intriguing. It’s a rock formation. It might look like a stack of pancakes, but made of rock. Or perhaps… you know what? Just go see for yourself.

<style="TXT-Objective">Land at the designated coordinates on <style=""OBJ-Minmus"">Minmus</style> to investigate the unusual rock formation.</style>"
Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Brief02,Text,,"We’re not sure what it is. It could be a unique geological formation, a result of some ancient <style=""OBJ-Minmus"">Minmus</style>ian tectonic activity. Try not to get too distracted by the minty-fresh ambiance. <style=""OBJ-Minmus"">Minmus</style> is lovely this time of year, or so I’ve heard. I’ve never actually been. I’m more of a… <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style> kind of Kerbal."
Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Brief03,Text,,"Good luck, and try not to eat the rocks. They’re not actually pancakes. I think."

Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Debrief01,Text,,"Welcome back! The geological analysis you made confirms the rock is a natural formation, likely caused by some unusual layering and erosion patterns. Nothing sentient, no alien device, no cosmic beings, just… rocks. Very interesting rocks, though!"
Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Debrief02,Text,,"We now have a much better understanding of <style=""OBJ-Minmus"">Minmus</style>’s geological history. And we also have some excellent new desktop backgrounds for <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style>."
Missions/Secondary/MTES09/Debrief03,Text,,"This would make an excellent picnic spot, I must say. I’m starting to think I missed out on a good opportunity there. Maybe we should organize a <style=""KSC-Mission-Control"">Mission Control</style> field trip to <style=""OBJ-Minmus"">Minmus</style> sometime."
